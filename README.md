# The Finest Crew #
Spaceship roguelike written in Google Go.

So, it is supposed to be a million-ton spaceship, bristling with weapons, shields, and other extremely complicated systems... and yet you, the player, can apparently control the entire thing yourself? Poppycock I say! In the Finest Crew, you are just one crew member. You may be in charge of the helm, weapons, shields, or another essential system. You may even reach the rank of captain, where you must coordinate the actions of the rest of the crew by giving orders. Yet, you cannot do it all.

And yes, a "million-ton spaceship". A dozen weapon banks with matching shield sections. Dozens of individual subsystems that get damaged in combat and degrade the ship. The enemy has these too.

## Why (does this exist)?
I wanted to teach myself the Google Go language. I hate doing work for no good reason, so I thought I could make a game at the same time. I chose to do a roguelike because I wanted to have the least amount of problems with input and output. On top of that, I have no artistic skills at all. With a roguelike I can rely on the user's imagination.

The idea of you playing just a single crew member is just a game idea I wanted to try. I also have always hated that most space simulations only have you flying a small fighter or freighter, never a big capital ship. While it might not come across well in a roguelike, I nonetheless wanted to emphasize that these are large spaceships that are more like steering the Titantic than some 3-person fishing boat.

Now one of the problems with having someone play just a single crew member is that it could boring quickly. The helmsman only steers the ship (generally based on captain's orders). That is rather limited. But pair that with the mechanics of a roguelike, and the ship can be destroyed (and the game restarted) quickly, and the player can get promoted through ship ranks quickly between rounds until they reach captain.
