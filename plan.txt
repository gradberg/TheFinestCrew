  --- Guns that fire multiple projectiles (so that big ships trying to counter little fighters can have shotgun-like guns systems with many projectiles fired per shot and bad precision so that they fan out)
  --- FireControl should have a full-screen view showing one picture of the ship in the middle, and all of the turrets arranged around it. It'd be a cool view
  --- Fire At Will mode - Fire at will can work well for very large ships with many gun batteries pointing various directions, and you may want to set the small guns to auto-fire on whatever is in range.

# PLAYABLE VERSION REQUIREMENTS #

## Alpha 1 
Two ship choices. One is a pirate fighter in which the one player controls everything, including helm and weapons. The second is a militia Corvette, with two possible crewmembers: Helmsman (duh) and Commander (weapons and orders)

Enemy ships will wander around until you are within range, and which point they will chase you. They will always fire at you when within range. You must fire at them and destroy them to finish 'waves' of enemies. (Slightly more each time?)

Combat: Ships consist only of hit points. Weapons would be projecticle/impact, which would bounce ships around.

On game startup, the player could choose which ship type they want (a fighter to match up against other fighters) or the militia corvette. If the second choice, then they pick which crew member they want to be. The game keeps track of destroyed pirate fighters, and when the player is finally destroyed (which depending on skill, will be when there are just too many enemies firing at you simultaneously), you will be presented with a death screen showing how many kills you got.

## Alpha 2
Add some more depth, so adding another role (Defense Officer), who has the responsbility of directing repair teams, which means implementing ship subsystems, and also implementing shields. 

With this role and those two game mechanics implemented, ships become much more fleshed-out and interesting.

Probably have a new, bigger ship, like a Destroyer, which could have a main turret fore and aft, with lasers covering the rest of the area. It would be nice to then have some information display so that crew members could see more detailed information about the ship they are on. Similiarly, the Personnel panel needs something to view all of the crew members, their names and such, so the 'world' is more 'discoverable'.

-- How will keyboard inputs compose nicely across all of the different panels. Specifically, as I implement more and more panels, it means that if they were combined in unexpected ways, it would be a problem if they ever shared keys.
@@ Fix RealTime toggle (Enter) incorrectly being active on full-screens
-- The player should be considered just another crew member with their decisions made using a IAiCrew module (which prompts the UI?)
-- Add in ship logs, which is every action by every crew member (and every random event) should be rcorded for future playback?
-- Need a more sophisticated list/iterator system, as parsing the lists themselves (and finding the next item after the existing item, which requires finding the list element) is quite tedious
-- Need some sort of logging so if a crash occurs, I can get a crash dump to fix it
-- Convert all headings and speeds into vectors?
-- multi-tick actions should let the game display the screen changes just like if you had realtime turned on, except you cannot stop it or pause it until those ticks are finished.
-- Reorganize codebase, if possible, into some sub-packages (CompassUtilities would probably extract nicely)
